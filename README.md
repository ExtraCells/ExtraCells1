ExtraCells
==========

No Support anymore! Use ExtraCells 2 for MC 1.7.x!

A mighty Add-On for Applied Energistics

To build this, download the project (ZIP or fork or whatever) and execute the build.bat/build.sh. The build files will be in /build/lib/

Thanks to arbrarsyed for ForgeGradle, to AlgorithmX2 for his massive support and his *amazing* API, cyntain and tgame14 for some very cool textures and Vexatos, crafteverywhere, SSCXM and VeryBigBro for the cool localizations!
